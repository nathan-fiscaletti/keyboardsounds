### Official Support

- Supports x86_64 Debian-based Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
- Supports X Window System (X11) -- does not support Wayland.

I'm interested in supporting other Linux distributions and Window managers, but I need help! As I'm unable to test the application on other Linux distributions, I'm looking for volunteers to help me test the application on other Linux distributions. If you are interested in helping, please [DM me on Discord](https://discord.gg/gysskqts6z).
